Make for Node.

Has a plugin system in which each plugin takes a JSON-like configuration input
which defines the tasks it provides.

Each configuration is a string, with a template system built-in of form `<%= %>`.

Grunt must be installed locally under `node_modules`.

Show help and list available tasks:

    grunt -h
